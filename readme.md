## Basic operations: Open XML SDK 2.5 Office Word documents
Introduction
This article will provide a solid base for performing common operations in Microsoft Word document 2007 format using Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office. What this article does not cover are drilling down each element type such as a paragraph element or what makes up a specific type of style be it for a paragraph or a table.
The intent is to provide examples for developers who have never worked with Open XML for Office documents to create documents quickly without getting into all the specifics.
